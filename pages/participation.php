In general a presentation should take 25&mdash;30 minutes followed by 5 minutes discussion.
</p>
<p>
The copyright of the paper remains with the author, but we reserve the right to create printed proceedings from all submitted (and accepted) papers.
</p>
<p>
Below is a list of possible subjects for papers and presentations. This list is
meant as a starting point, not to restrict you.

<p>
We very much welcome practical papers or software demos that outline artistic creative processes or workflows based on Linux audio applications or systems ("how I use Linux Audio applications to create my music/media art").
</p>
<p>
Not all papers need to directly address Linux Audio. There is no limitation for subjects from related fields like audio/visual research and open-content.
</p>

<p>NB. Papers should be as complete as possible on submission. Until submission closes it is possible to replace/update files in the <a href="<?=CANONICALURL?>openconf/">openconf</a> system. Submissions will be peer-reviewed and after the notification of acceptance there is a small time-window for updates and last-minute changes.
