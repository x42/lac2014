In general a presentation should take about half an hour.

<p>
The copyright of the paper remains with the author, but we reserve the right to create and sell printed proceedings from all submitted (and accepted) papers.
</p>

<p>
For <strong>poster</strong> submissions please submit an abstract and at least two pages written documentation about the subject which can be included in the conference-proceedings (please use one of the templates).
</p>

<p>
For <strong>lightning-talks</strong> we only require an abstract (50&mdash;250 words), the presentation will be about 5 minutes. You may optionally provide written documentation for inclusion in the printed proceedings (please use one of the templates, minimum two pages).

With exception of submission-length and presentation duration, the same rules as for papers also apply to poster submissions and lightning-talks.
