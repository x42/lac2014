<em>Will you still be around Sunday afternoon?</em>
<br/>
The final event of the conference will be a trip to to &laquo;<a rel="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruchsal">Bruchsal</a>&raquo;, a village in the &laquo;Kranichgau&raquo;, the hilly region in between the Black Forest and Odenwald about 30 minutes from Karlsruhe.

The specifics regarding the excursion are yet to be confirmed (ETA 7/April/2014). The general outline is as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li>At <strong>12:00</strong> we will visit the Museum For Music Automata: <a rel="external" href="http://www.dmm-bruchsal.de/">Deutsches Musikautomten-Museum</a> located in the Château of Bruchsal. (Visiting the museum is voluntary, and you can stay as long as you wish until the museum closes at 17h.)
<br/>
<em>
The Museum houses the most important collection of music machines worldwide. The around 500 exhibits of the museum include developments from early handicraft production of the 17th and 18th Century until its golden age in the industrial age of the late 19th Century and finally to the demise of the mechanical automata during the time of the Great Depression in the late twenties in the 20th Century.</em></li>
<li>Around <strong>15:00</strong> we'll meet in a tavern close-by (<a href="http://www.brauhaus-wallhall-bruchsal.de/">Brauhaus Wallhall</a> - to be confirmed) to close the conference in style. Participation is voluntary but highly recommended :)</li>
</ul>
